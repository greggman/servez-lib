# servez-lib

A simple server used in the [command line servez](https://github.com/greggman/servez-cli)
and the [app servez](https://greggman.github.io/servez).

This is not meant to be a library for others to use to expand on. If you're making your
own server and you like this library I suggest you just copy the code rather than make
your project dependent on this one.
